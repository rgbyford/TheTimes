# TheTimes

I haven't quite followed the instructions.

The app only puts an article into the database when you ask it to.

The "Add a note" button changes to "Edit note" if there is already a note attached to the article.

The "Save" button does not appear if the article is already in the database and the note has not been changed.

Adding / editing a note does not automatically save the article.  It does make the "Save" button reappear.
